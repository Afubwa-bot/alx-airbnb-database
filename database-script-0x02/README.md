# ðŸ§ª Database Seeding Script (`seed.sql`)

This directory contains the **SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML)** script for populating the `alx_airbnb` database with **realistic sample data**.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

The `seed.sql` file complements the `schema.sql` by inserting a complete set of sample data that mimics real-world Airbnb usage. This is essential for:
- Local development and UI testing
- Backend logic testing (e.g., filtering, searching, booking logic)
- Demo or presentation scenarios

---

## ðŸ“„ Tables Populated

Data is inserted in a **logical order** to satisfy foreign key constraints and application behavior:

1. **User** â€“ Creates a variety of users with roles like `host`, `guest`, and `admin`.
2. **Property** â€“ Adds property listings tied to hosts.
3. **Booking** â€“ Simulates bookings across different time ranges (past, current, future).
4. **Payment** â€“ Records corresponding payments (full and partial).
5. **Review** â€“ Inserts feedback left by guests after completed stays.
6. **Message** â€“ Simulates in-app communication between users.
